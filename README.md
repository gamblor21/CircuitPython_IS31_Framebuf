# CircuitPython_IS31_Framebuf
Circuitpython python framebuffer extension supporting the IS31FL3741 chipset

This is an early proof of concept, work in progress. The performance is poor at this time if you try to use the scale option to take a larger framebuf and size it down to the matrix. Using it in 18x5 mode works much faster.

It is currently hardcoded for only the LED glasses from Adafruit.
